# 🌦️ South African Weather Data Scraper & Analyzer

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a Python-based tool that automates the process of **scraping, cleaning, and analyzing weather data** for various cities and provinces in South Africa. Using the `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` libraries, it extracts real-time weather metrics from [WeatherSA](https://www.weathersa.co.za) and stores the processed data in a structured format for easy analysis.
